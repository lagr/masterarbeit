In the following, expectations towards the functionality of the resulting \ac{WfMS} are established in a structured manner. These functionalities are grouped by the component groups of a \ac{WfMS}, which are described in \ref{sub:system_components}.
% Besides the rigid functional objectives there are also less tangible ones. Although they are harder to quantify, they are likely to have an impact on the value of the produced artifacts. The functionalities that are worked out in this c lose value if using them is cumbersome and they are avoided in consequence. Concerning the scope of this thesis, the functionalities that should be facilitated are
% \begin{itemize}[nosep]
%   \item the modeling of workflows;
%   \item the export and distribution of workflows; and
%   \item the selection of images from Docker Hub for the use in a workflow;
% \end{itemize}
The resulting objectives and the requirements that need to be met in order to fulfill them are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:objectives_and_requirements}.

\subsection*{Infrastructure and Infrastructure Management} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:infrastructure_management}

    As the IT environment of an organization changes over time, %claim?
    the \ac{WfMS} should be structured in a way that allows the adaption to such changes with the least possible system downtime. \\
    Further, it should be possible to add servers to the system during execution time, which then should be usable with a minimum of manual configuration.

    If an organization is unable to perform its business processes, it is likely to suffer from financial losses. Any failure of a business critical \ac{WfMS} can thus cause severe problems for an organization. The \ac{WfMS} developed in this thesis should thus be resilient towards failures, \ie provide as much functionality as possible if a part of it fails and try to recover autonomously. This requires well separated modules.

\subsection*{Workflow Modeling} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:workflow_modeling}

    One benefit of Docker containers is, that full application stacks can be bundled with all their dependencies and pre-configured regarding their invocation \cite[p.~82]{Bernstein2014Containers}. The result can be considered as a black box that provides some specific functionality and that could be used without further configuration. In combination with the facilitated sharing of images through repositories, this provides a foundation for modular reuse and combination \cite[p.~6]{Boettiger2015Introduction}.
    In order to reap this advantage, \ac{WfMS} should enable modeling developers to incorporate the invocation of third party images from within their workflows. This includes the specification of parameters, with which the image should be run.

    In case that an execution node is working to full capacity, a means should be provided to support the swift finalization of time-critical tasks before those that are not, \eg the temperature analysis of a cold storage with sensitive goods which is prioritized over the automated reorder of tacks for the office. The modeling environment should thus enable the user to put restrictions on the resource usage of specific activities in order to prioritize or demote them.

\subsection*{Workflow Distribution} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:workflow_distribution}
    In the course of a \ac{WfMS}'s life cycle, many workflows are modeled and many activities are created, and both are likely to be updated occasionally. In order to reduce administrative work, workflows and their activities should be distributed to their correct execution servers after these events in an automated way.
% - produced workflows should be as portable/environment independent as possible

  % subsection workflow_distribution (end)

\subsection*{Workflow Execution} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:workflow_execution}
      All containers that are related to the execution of workflows should be started by the \ac{WfMS} without user interaction.

      The IT infrastructure in an organization may be heterogeneous in terms of machine capabilities and environment, \eg the amount of memory that is available or the geographic location of the machine. These factors may be of interest when it comes to performance objectives or legal regulations. The scheduling of workflows or activities to nodes for execution should thus be possible based on a structured description of said properties.

      In \ref{sub:workflow_data}, various forms of data visibility and interaction were presented. Russel et al. examined the capabilities of various workflow engines with regards to these characteristics \cite{Russell2005Workflow}. The should support at least those forms of data visibility and interaction that are common among existing solutions. As a rough estimation for this, each capability shall be deemed as required if a majority of solutions examined in that study supports it. The resulting capabilities are presented in Table~\ref{tab:required_data_visibility_and_data_interaction_types}.
