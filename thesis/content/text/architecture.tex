  Use Docker only for execution vs docker all the things

  Developers of software systems have to cope with factors which impose challenges on them, such as high complexity within their systems, an increased need for integration of internal and external functionality and evolving technologies. Several architectural approaches emerged from the attempt to overcome these challenges. Strîmbei et al consider \emph{monolithic architecture}, \emph{\ac{SOA}} and \emph{Micro-services} to be the most relevant \cite[p.~13]{Strimbei2015Software}.

  \paragraph{Monolithic Architecture} % (fold)
    \label{par:monolithic_architecture}
    Monolithic software systems are characterized by their cohesive structure. Usually, components in a monolith are organized within one programm, often running in one process \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}. They communicate through shared memory and direct function calls. Monolithic applications are typically written using one programming language \cite[p.~14]{Strimbei2015Software}. In order to cope with increasing workload on a monolithic system, multiple instances of it are run behind a load balancer \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}.

    The strengths of monolithic architecture lie mostly in its comparably simple demands towards the infrastructure. As the application is run as one entity, deployment and networking are rather simple \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}. Since data can be shared via memory or disk, monolithic applications can access it faster than it would be the case with networked components \cite[p.~14]{Strimbei2015Software}. \\
    Also, as the interaction between the application's components happens XYZ, the complexity of this interaction is lower compared to interaction between distributed components \cite[p.~14]{Strimbei2015Software}.

    The weaknesses of monolithic architecture stem from its cohesive nature. As its components are usually tightly coupled, changes to one component can affect other parts of the application, which complicates the introduction of new components and the refactoring of existing ones \cite{Stubbs2015Distributed}.
    Components cannot be deployed individually, which hinders reuse of functionality across several applications more difficult and makes scaling of single bootleneck components impossible \cite{Stubbs2015Distributed}. Also, if the application runs in a single process, the failure of one component may bring down the whole application \cite[p.~5]{Newman2015Building}.

  \paragraph{Service-oriented Architecture} % (fold)
    \label{par:service_oriented_architecture}
    \ac{SOA} is based on the idea that code which provides related business functions can be bundled into one component which offers said functionality to other systems \emph{as a service}, thus avoiding duplicated implementation of the functionalities among these systems \cite[p.8]{Hohpe2004Enterprise}.
    An application may then use several services in order to fulfill its own business function \cite[p.~390]{Papazoglou2007Service}.
    The \ac{OASIS} describes \ac{SOA} as an architectural paradigm that supports the organization and usage of these services \cite{Standards2006Reference}. Each service provider exposes its offered services in a standardized way, \eg using \ac{WSDL}, which can then be utilized by \emph{service consumers} \cite[p.~390]{Papazoglou2007Service}, \cite[p.~17]{Strimbei2015Software}.

    Messages between services in \ac{SOA} are either of direct nature, which is called point-to-point connection, or backed by a message bus, the \ac{ESB} which incorporates the integration logic, \eg on transport and transformation of messages, between services and supports asynchronous messages \cite[p.~393]{Papazoglou2007Service}. While the former leads to tight coupling between the components, which becomes impractical with increasing numbers of endpoints, the latter manages this scenario better \cite[p.~393]{Papazoglou2007Service}.

    On the one hand, \ac{SOA} has some advantages in comparison to monolithic architecture.
    Service consumers do not have to make assumptions - or know - how services work, they only have to rely on the invokation of a service and its result to be formed as expected \cite[p.~390]{Papazoglou2007Service}. As long as the interface and the output of existing services do not change, a service provider may thus be altered or its capabilities be extended without affecting its services' consumers \cite[p.~390]{Papazoglou2007Service}. \ac{SOA} thus enhances an organization’s ability to respond quickly to changes \cite[p.~390]{Papazoglou2007Service}, \cite[p.~254]{Choi2010Implementing}. \\
    Since legacy applications can be provided with appropriate interfaces, SOA can help to integrate and extend them \cite[p.~390]{Papazoglou2007Service}.

    On the other hand, \ac{SOA} has some drawbacks, too.
    For example, the failure of a single service provider may bring down multiple applications that consume its services, if no fallback measures are in place \cite[p.~408f]{Papazoglou2007Service}.
    Also, the overall performance of an application with \ac{SOA} depends on the aggregated performances of the services it uses and their respective interactions \cite[p.~408f]{Papazoglou2007Service}.

    In combination with Docker, a possible solution could look like this: ...
    % paragraph service_oriented_architecture (end)

  \paragraph{Micro-services Architecture} % (fold)
    \label{par:micro_services_architecture}
    The concept of \ac{MSA} is closely related to that of \ac{SOA}, as it also promotes the encapsulation of functionality in standalone services which can be used by other parts of a system. There is unambiguity whether \ac{MSA} is actually a concept on its own -- or rather a specialized application of \ac{SOA} \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}, \cite[p.~17]{Strimbei2015Software}.
    Stubbs et al describe \ac{MSA} as a distributed system that consists of independent services which are   narrowly focused and thus considered ``lightweight'' \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}.
    That exact principle has been described as a version of \ac{SOA} before \cite[p.~395]{Papazoglou2007Service}.

    Strîmbei et al created a differentiation between SOA and MSA as a distinct concept based on several sources. They come to the conclusion, that while the communication in \ac{SOA} is synchronous and ``smart but dependency-laden'', \ac{MSA} relies on asynchronous, ``dumb, fast messaging'' -- meaning that there is few information on the participating services contained in the messaging infrastructure. Further, they perceive applications in \ac{SOA} to be typically imperative in their programming style, while \ac{MSA} would be in an event-driven programming style \cite[pp.~17-20]{Strimbei2015Software}. They see \ac{SOA} applications as being usually stateful and \ac{MSA} applications as stateless. Finally they characterize the databases in \ac{SOA} as large relational databases and the databases in \ac{MSA} as small, often non-relational databases.

    One benefit of \ac{MSA}, which it shares with \ac{SOA} is that each service can be developed in a language and with a toolset that suits its specific needs, \eg a lower-level language for time-critical but simple tasks or a high-level language with some framework for complex ones, instead of having to find a compromise that suits most of the application  \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}, \cite[p.~4]{Newman2015Building}, \cite[p.~113]{Thones2015Microservices}.
    The narrow focus of each service makes it less specialized to certain uses, which should theoretically enable better reuse of code \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}.
    Another positive aspect is the \emph{resilience} of micro-services when it comes to service failures, that is, a single failing service does not render the whole system incapable of working \cite[p.~5]{Newman2015Building}.
    Due to the properties of the \ac{MSA}, micro-services may be deployed, upgraded and scaled individually \cite[p.~116]{Thones2015Microservices}.

    Researchers also see disadvantages and problems that may go hand in hand with the use of \ac{MSA}.
    While \ac{MSA} facilitates deploying parts of an application individually, the overall amount of work required for the deployment of all services is higher and the coordination of the deployments is complexer than the deployment of a monolithic application.
    As services may be unavailable at times, a mechanism has to be in place that allows the discovery of services (such as the \ac{MOM}) \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}.
    Unless a dedicated service is introduced, there is no central access to the services' logs. Aggregation, analysis and fixing errors is thus more complicated in comparison to monolithic architecture \cite[p.~35]{Stubbs2015Distributed}.
    In order to define the different services, it is necessary to find the right size for each service, \ie the appropriate scope of its functionality. This process is difficult and not needed to this extend in monolithic architectures or \ac{SOA}.

    In combination with Docker, a possible solution could look like this: ...

  \paragraph{Choice of an architecture model} % (fold)
    \label{par:choice_of_an_achitecture_model}

    One central requirement for the stated objectives is the modularization of the application. It enables the containment of failures, the replacement or upgrading of components at runtime, and the individual scaling of parts of the \ac{WfMS}. The concept of \ac{SOA} and \ac{MSA} inherently requires the modularization of code, while it is optional -- yet, advisable -- in a monolithic architecture.

    While measures can be taken in monolithic applications to cope with failure of components to some degree, if the underlying machine fails or the process dies for whatever reason, the whole application is rendered inoperative \cite[p.~55]{Newman2015Building}. \ac{SOA} and \ac{MSA} both urge to account for the possibility of a non-responding service -- in the first place because of the unreliability of network communication, but that works or any other reason, too. They hence inherently support the objective of resilience better than monolithic architecture.

    Upgrading or replacing components of an application at runtime is possible in each of the presented architectures. In \ac{SOA} the service may be replaced at will by directing requests to an instance of the new version of that service, given that the previously exhibited behavior does not change. The same applies for \ac{MSA}, but as there is no direct messaging, the replaced components just have to adhere to the expected messaging scheme. Monolithic applications may introduce patterns such as dependency injection and dynamic loading to make changes at runtime possible.

    Even though scaling individual parts of an application is a non-trivial task in \ac{SOA} and \ac{MSA}, it is possible. With a monolithic architecture, scaling the whole application is usually easier than in \ac{SOA} and \ac{MSA} -- in most cases, another instance of the application may be started for that purpose --, but it is not possible to scale only those parts of an application where performance bottlenecks arise.

    Facing these considerations, monolithic architecture is ruled out as the favored application structure. In the following, only the decision between \ac{SOA} and \ac{MOM} thus has to be made.

    The Docker Ecosystem facilitates the setup of the infrastructure for a \ac{MSA}. As stated in \ref{par:micro_services_architecture}, the \ac{MOM} itself contains little to no knowledge about the system using it. Thus, the \ac{MOM} and all application components may simply be started in separate containers and connected using an overlay network.

    Docker permits the configuration of restart policies for specific containers. In case that one container crashes, it is restarted with its previous settings, if configured so.

    This reasoning leads to the overall conclusion, that micro-services are the architecture of choice with regards to the chosen objectives.

\subsection{Components} % (fold)
\label{sub:components}
  As noted in \ref{par:micro_services_architecture}, one of the downsides of \ac{MSA} is that suitable service boundaries have to be determined. Some sources advise to first build a monolithic application and then analyze the result to single out services that can be extracted. In case of a \ac{WfMS}, the identification of system components by the \ac{WFMC} can be interpreted as such an analysis. Based on those components, described in \ref{sub:system_components}, further subordinate micro-services are then identified.

  As described in \ref{sub:system_components}, the \ac{WFMC} identified:
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
      \item Software Components
        \begin{itemize}[nosep]
          \item Definition Tool

  \paragraph{Validation Service} % (fold)
    \label{par:valitation_service}
    One micro-service that might be extracted from the above services concerns the validation of data is the validation service. Given a dataset and a set of rules on how to validate this dataset, the service is able to perform its task autonomously. As validation is a frequently recurring action in the execution of workflows -- before and after each activity and workflow -- it could be beneficial to be able to scale the execution of this task independently.

  \subsubsection{Support Services} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:support_components}
    There are three services which are required for the infrastructure in order to achieve the specified objectives. First, some \ac{MOM}, as it enables the communication between all components. Second, a service that allows the configuration of the execution environment. And third, a component that takes care of provisioning all machines with the images they require.

      \label{par:provisioning_service}
        The objectives include the reduction of administrative work. In order to prevent the user from having to distribute the Docker images required for the execution of workflows manually, a service should perform this task. This service should provision each machine with said images whenever such an image is created or updated. If a workflow or an activity is deleted, the service should remove its respective image from all machines.

        The service could either run as an instance on each machine, performing the required Docker operations locally, or run on the Docker Swarm master machine as one instance and perform the operations remotely on all machines.

- inter-component communication
  - RabbitMQ was introduced to the project, which implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
  - AMQP consists of three structural parts [Ze15]:
    - Exchanges
      -  are the contact point for incoming messages, where the publishers deliver their messages [Ze15].
    - Queues
      - are used to deliver messages. This is were consumers subscribe, in order to receive all messages which get delivered to a certain queue. If no consumer is registered on the queue, the messages are stored [Ze15]
    - Routes
      -  describe the mapping between exchanges and routes. They define which requirements a message needs to meet, in order to be placed inside a certain queue [Ze15].

- docker for workflow execution
  - base images
