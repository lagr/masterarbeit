The digital revolution has brought with it a variety of new challenges for many enterprises, forcing the need for agility in an increasingly fragile market environment.
To cope with technological advance and competitive pressure through shortened time-to-market phases and reduced entry hurdles for market newcomers, enterprises need to adapt quickly to new technologies and business models.
Coupled with the need to optimize costs, these developments have furthered the emergence of services known as Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)\cite[p.~606]{Buyya2009Cloud}.
These concepts offer a high degree of flexibility as they can be swiftly scaled to changing consumption patterns, while at the same time allow a sharing of resources among users of these services.
To be able run software in a heterogeneous infrastructure that features such services, various approaches have been presented which help to provide a predictable runtime environment \cite[p.~81]{Bernstein2014Containers}. One of them is the use of software containers which provide a way of packaging and executing processes that isolates the application from the underlying \ac{OS} of a computer and other processes that run on it.

The concept of software containers is no new notion: an early predecessor was the \texttt{chroot} command, which dates back to 1979, \emph{software jails} followed in 1998 \cite[p.~82]{Bernstein2014Containers}.
In the second decade of the \nth{21} century, solutions like Rocket, LXD, and Docker emerged, which aim at the introduction of standardized, re-usable software containers, usually in combination with tools for their management. Among these solutions, Docker is very popular. In the beginning of 2016, Docker's repository was the \nth{20} most ``starred'' repository on the source code management platform \emph{GitHub} -- ranking four positions behind the Linux kernel repository \cite{Github2016Repositories}. Docker comes with a set of utilities, which extend its main container-related functionality by features that help to set up, provision, and manage a distributed environment.

Organizations perform temporal and logical sequences of actions that help to interact with business relevant entities -- business processes -- with the objective to reach their business goals. If these processes are coordinated in an automated way, they are also called \emph{workflows}. \acp{WfMS} are designed to support the definition, execution and monitoring of these workflows \cite{Becker1999Identifying,Hollingsworth1995Wfmc}.
With regards to the challenges that heterogeneous and distributed \ac{IT} environments as described above impose on \acp{WfMS} -- \eg the distribution of workflows to their location of enactment, the requirement to be able to adapt to increasing workload or manage the remote execution of tasks -- it could be of interest to fathom possible benefits that may arise from the use of the Docker tool set in the context of these \acp{WfMS}. The primary objectives of the thesis at hand are thus to address the following questions and to derive artifacts from the findings that may serve as a foundation for the conceptualization and implementation of future Docker-based \acp{WfMS}:

\begin{description}[nosep]
  \item[RQ1:] How can Docker leverage the deployment and execution of workflows in a distributed environment?
  \item[RQ2:] Which decisions in software architecture and software design of a WFMS are complemented by Docker's functionality?
\end{description}

Queries on the research portal Scopus with the search terms `docker AND wfms' and `docker AND ``workflow management system''' on November \nth{6} 2015 yielded no results for existing research. A search conducted during the implementation with the same queries on Google Scholar returned a publication by Zheng and Thain which is focused on using Docker to provide controllabe runtime environments for the execution of tasks in the Makeflow \ac{WfMS} \cite{Zheng2015Integrating}. Compared to its topic, the scope of the thesis at hand broader as it aims to find general uses for Docker in \ac{WfMS}.

The structure of this thesis follows the design science research process suggested by Peffers et al. \cite[pp.~89-92]{Peffers2007Design}. The research problem is identified in this very chapter and chapters \ref{cha:workflow_management_systems}, \ref{cha:docker} and \ref{cha:architecture_styles}, in which the fundamental concepts of \acp{WfMS} and Docker as well as architecture styles are introduced.
Based on considerations drawn from these concepts, the objectives of a solution are inferred and a prototype is designed in Chapter~\ref{cha:solution_design}. The design and implementation of the prototype is described in chapters \ref{cha:solution_design} and \ref{cha:implementation} respectively. In Chapter~\ref{cha:evaluation}, the developed mechanisms and the prototype are evaluated. Finally, the findings of this thesis are summarized and suggestions for subsequent research are presented in Chapter\ref{cha:conclusion}.
